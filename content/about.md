### What is that supposed to mean?

Your guess is as good as mine.

### Who are you?

That's a complicated question, but my name is Dan.

### How do I contact you?

You can email me at dan at this domain (i.e., laserkittens dot com).

### Why did you write your email address that way?

Unfortunately, the Internet is filled with trolls who scour websites looking for email addresses to send spam to. This thwarts the majority of them from harvesting my email address. It also stymies people who can't figure out how to swap "@" for "at" and "." for "dot", but I'm not sure that's a bad thing.
